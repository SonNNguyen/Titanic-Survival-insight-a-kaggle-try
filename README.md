# Titanic-Survival-insight-a-kaggle-try
So I decide to work through the insight of Titanic tragedy with a glance at the Data (famously) provided on Kaggle.

In (1) I chose to search for these issues:
- Survival/Gender/Age relationship
- Survival/Class/Location of depart (Embarked) relationship
- Survival/ Company status of passengers (sipsp-parch) relationship

Put together the most suprising discovery was 'turn out, boys (male kids <10) has an unexpectly high chance of death over the rest of the story we've known about Titanic tragedy.
